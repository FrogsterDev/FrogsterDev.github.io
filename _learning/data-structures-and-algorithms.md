# Welcome :)

I decided to study Data Structures and Algorithms and make some notes for the future,
after some time I forgot most of the stuff so this time I make notes and also I will
solve leetcode problems so it will be also nice place to showcase my code.
I will link all the solutions in seperate files in separate directory, however pseudo-code will
be provided here with all of the visualizations also made by me.
